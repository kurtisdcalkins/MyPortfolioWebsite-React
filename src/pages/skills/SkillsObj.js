        tiny tubes attached to a small part that was to be Parylene-coated.
        Parylene deposition is performed under vacuum and the coating is
        deposited molecule-by-molecule as a gas. Therefore, masking needs to
        produce a gas-tight barrier. Through, hundreds of tests, I determined
        that the slight variation in the lengths of the tubes cause some to be
        masked perfectly and others to not be due to technique differences used
